# SpyoSecure-Scammer-Troller
This is a program designed to help you generate humorous and trolling responses to your friends' messages using AI.

For making the program work, you need to install some libraries for Python. Here is the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the program to generate funny and trolling responses. Here is the step-by-step guide to use it:

### Steps to Run the Program

1. **Initialize the environment**:
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file is located.

2. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Enter the message**:
    - When prompted, type the message you want to get a trolling response for.

4. **View the response**:
    - The program will display the response generated by the AI.

5. **Continue or Exit**:
    - After viewing the response, you can choose to enter another message or exit the program.

### Note

After entering the message, the program will attempt to generate a funny and trolling response multiple times until it gets a valid one (since the API is not the official OpenAI one).
